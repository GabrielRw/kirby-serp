# Snippets

There is also [a few snippets](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-serp/tree/master/snippets) registered by this plugin. If you are not satisfied with how they work, you can override them by adding your own snippets with the same names in `site/snippets`.

Be aware that they are prefixed by `serp-` by default.
