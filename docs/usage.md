## No flag

If you have no warning flag it means that both the seo title tag and the seo description has content. It does not measure quality in any way.

### Yellow flag

The yellow warning shows that you have a missing description, but have a seo title. It's not the end of the world, because Google will often generate an own description if it's missing.

### Red flag

The red warning shows that you have a missing title. It's important to fix because Google see it as a very important ranking factor.
